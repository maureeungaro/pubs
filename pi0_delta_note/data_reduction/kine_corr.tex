\section{Kinematic corrections}
The kinematic corrections presented here are based on the elastic kinematics
and the incident electron beam energy value. Both  these matters are important,
and therefore discussed below.

After selecting elastic events, systematic deviations are found on electron and proton angles 
and on electron momentum. No significant error is found on proton momemtum.

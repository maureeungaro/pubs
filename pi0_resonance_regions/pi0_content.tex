\maketitle

\abstract{We report the analysis of exclusive single $\pi^0$
electroproduction in the resonance region
at Jefferson Lab in the $Q^2$ range $2 \rightarrow 6$ GeV$^2$.
 $\pi^0$ c.m. angular distributions are obtained over the
entire 4 $\pi$ c.m. solid angle. The c.m. differential cross
sections and beam spin asymmetries are measured. }

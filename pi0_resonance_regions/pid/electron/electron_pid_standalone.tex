\title{\large e1-6 Electron Identification}
\maketitle

\abstract{This chapter describes the electron identification for the e1-6 dataset.
The candidate electrons are all the negative time-based tracks that passed the hardware trigger.
The cuts are based on the candidate's reconstructed momentum and its signals on
the Electromagnetic Calorimeter and the \v Cerenkov counter.
When needed, the cuts are sector-dependent.}

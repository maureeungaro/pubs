\title{\large e1-6 Proton Identification}
\maketitle

\abstract{This chapter describes the proton identification for the e1-6 data.
The candidate protons are all the events containing at least one positive time-based track, after the electron identification.
The cuts are based on the candidate's reconstructed momentum and its signals on
the Time of Flight (TOF)\cite{bib:ftof}. The cuts are sector-dependent.}

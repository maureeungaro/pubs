\subsection{Number of photo-electrons in the \v Cerenkov detector}
\label{sec:cc_cut}
In the past a threshold for the signal in the \v Cerenkov detector was necessary to eliminate
electronic noise and the fact that negative pions produce \v Cerenkov light when 
their momentum is above $\sim 2.5$ GeV.

The ADC signal from the CC is converted in 
{\it number of photo-electrons} (nphe) and
multiplied by 10. The number of photo-electrons detected in the \v Cerenkov
Counter for electrons is typically between 5 and 20, or $10\times nphe_{el} \sim 50-200$.
You can see from Fig.\,\ref{fig:cccut_alls} the $10\times nphe$
distribution in each sector.

The peak at $nphe \sim 1$ represents not only background and
negative pions, but good electrons with low CC efficency hits. For this reason
it's better to apply the CC $\theta$, $\phi$ and Timing match cuts.

In average (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cccut_alls}) only $\sim 25\%$ of candidates pass the calorimeter cuts. 
If applied, the nphe cut would keep $\sim 90\%$ of them.

The $nphe$ cut is chosen visually to be at the minimum
of the $nphe$ distribution between the background and electron signals peak.

               $\sim 90 \,^{\circ\!\!}/\!_\circ$ pass the $nphe$ cut.}

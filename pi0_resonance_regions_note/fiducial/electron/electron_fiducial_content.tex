\section{Fiducial Cuts}




\subsection{Introduction}

A fiducial cut on electrons is introduced to constrain regions of phase space
where the CLAS response peaks at its maximum and remains rather smooth.
Furthermore, some detector inefficiencies are not perfectly reproduced with GSIM and need to be
removed with dedicated cuts.

Traditionally, the fiducial regions are defined in the lab coordinates of the electron reconstructed $\phi, \theta, p$.
However, it is more natural to define the fiducial regions in the detector coordinates, because
the inefficiencies are caused by tracks near their borders or hardware problems.

Since the former approach has been used in several published CLAS papers, we will keep it both as a reference
and for comparison with the new approach.

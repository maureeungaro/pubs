\abstract{
    GEMC is a Monte-Carlo program that uses database to build
    experimental setups.
    The databases (MYSQL, CSQL, TEXT) define geometry,
    materials, digitization algorithms, readout electronics
    and output formats.

    GEMC is written in C++ and uses Geant4 for the passage of particles through matter.
    It includes a python API to builde detectors and populate the databases.

    Real-life scenarios include geometry variations and run number
    dependency of calibration constants and digitization parameters.

    An overview of the software and some examples are shown.
    The usage of GEMC at Jefferson Lab in the CLAS12 experimental program is showcased.

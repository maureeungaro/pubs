\abstract{
    GEMC is a program that uses databases to run Geant4
    Monte-Carlo simulations.
    The databases (MYSQL, CSQL, TEXT) define the geometry,
    materials, digitization algorithms, readout electronics
    and output formats.

    GEMC is written in C++. Included is a python API to builde detectors a
    nd populate the databases.

    Real-life scenarios such as geometry variations and run number
    dependency of calibration constants / digitization parameters are
    built in the framework.

    An overview of the software and some examples are shown.
    The usage of GEMC at Jefferson Lab in the CLAS12 experimental program is
    showcased.

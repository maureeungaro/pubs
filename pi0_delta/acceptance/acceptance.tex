\section{MonteCarlo simulation}
A realistic acceptance calculation must take in account the CLAS detector 
geometry, efficiency and resolution.
The program that simulates the response of CLAS is {\bf GSIM} ({\bf G}EANT {\bf Sim}ulation)
based on the GEANT 3 libraries developed at CERN.
What follows
are the steps to achieve the desired simulation.

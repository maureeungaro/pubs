\subsection{Beam Energy measurement} 
The beam energy value chosen for this analysis is the result of measurements from Hall A, which
has two means of computing the beam energy:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\boldmath \bf $e,P$ method:} it is based on the angle measurement in the two bodies $^1H(e,e' P)$ kinematics.
\item{\bf ``arc'' method:}  it is based on the use of a section of the beam transport line as a magnetic spectometer.
\end{itemize}
Both these method are used during Hall-A experiments.

During e1-6 data acquisition time such a measurement was taken on 
2/11/2002 (during this experiment) and it gave as results:
$$
\begin{array}{c c c c}
e,P & & 5754.41 \pm 1.76 & {\rm GeV}\\
ARC & & 5754.4 \pm 1 & {\rm GeV}\\
\end{array}
$$
Based on the above, the beam energy value chosen for this analysis is:
$$
E = 5.7544 \,\,\,{\rm GeV}
$$

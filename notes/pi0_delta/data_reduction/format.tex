\section{SEB and PID}
\label{sec:seb_pid}

During the data processing the particle ID is done in two ways, so that two bos banks contain
the calculated four momenta of all the particles in the event,
the EVNT and PART banks. EVNT is based on the SEB 
algorithm (Simple Event Builder) while PART is based on 
the PID algorithm. Both yield similar result for 
all the particles except the electrons, where PID 
is more restrictive than SEB. 

The resulting particle ID is not final. What follow illustrates the work
to refine and improve it.

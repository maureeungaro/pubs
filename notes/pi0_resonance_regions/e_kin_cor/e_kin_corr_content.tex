\section{Electron Kinematic Correction}

\subsection{Introduction}

The reconstructed momentum of the electron is slightly incorrect, due to
drift chamber misalignments and an inaccurate magnetic field map
This is reflected on quantities like $W$ or missing masses, and directly affect this
analysis cuts and acceptance calculations.

Here we apply the same momentum correction extrapolated in~\cite{bib:pi0_Delta}.
The resulting elastic peak $W$, the $eP(\pi^0)$ and $eP(\eta)$ missing masses
are improved as shown in the following sample of plots.

the correction is available in appendix~\ref{app:mom_corr_pars}.

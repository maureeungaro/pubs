\subsection{EC Threshold}
A study \cite{bib:ecmin} of the inclusive cross section at various beam energies in CLAS
results in a parametrization of the low momentum cut $p_{min}$ as a function of
the calorimeter low total threshold (in milliVolts) of the trigger discriminator:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:pmin}
    p_{min}\,\,{\rm (MeV)} = 214 + 2.47\times EC_{threshold}{\rm (mV)}
\end{equation}

The low total threshold for e1-6 was $172$ mV therefore the minimum momentum cut is fixed at:
$$
p_{min} = 0.64\,\,{\rm GeV}
$$

Fig.~\ref{fig:pmincut_alls} shows for the momentum distribution of the candidates integrated
over all sectors. In average, $\sim 27.7\%$  pass the all other particle ID
cuts and of these, $91.9\%$ pass the minimum $p$ cut.

The cut value used is the same for all sectors and its effectiveness is summarized in
table\,\ref{tab:pmincut}.

        pass the all other particle ID cuts and of these, $92.5 \,^{\circ\!\!}/\!_\circ$
        pass the minimum $p$ cut.}

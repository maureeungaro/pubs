\subsection{CC phi Matching}\label{subsec:cc-phi-matching}
The principle of this cut is very simple: when the track is on the right of the CC, the right
photo-multiplier should fire, and vice-versa.
Exception: when $\phi$ (relative to the center in each sector) is less
than $4^0$ the track is kept (the \v Cerenkov light should hit both pmts,
but with less efficiency since it splits in the middle)
~\cite{bib:ccmatch,bib:pc_fxpun,bib:pc_osi}.

To show the effects of this cut the quantity ``$\phi$ matching'' is plotted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ccm_phi}.
This quantity is $0$ when both pmts are fired, $1(-1)$ when
there is a left (right) match and $2(-2)$ there is a left (right) mismatch.
The cut applied is: ``$\phi$ matching''$<2$ except when $|\phi|<4^0$.

\subsection{Summary of Electron Identification }
In Fig.~\ref{fig:epidsummary} a summary of the electron identifications cuts in all sectors is shown:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Individual cuts effect: this is the percentage of events that would be selected by each
    individual cut if it was the only cut applied.
    \item Effectiveness: this is the percentage of events that are selected by each individual cut when
    all the other cuts are effective.
    \item Cumulative: this is the percentage of events that are selected by each individual cut when
    they are applied in the order show.
\end{itemize}

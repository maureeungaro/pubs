\subsection{Track Coordinates in the EC plane}
The EC is designed for the electron to release all their energy in it.
However electrons that shower near the edges of the calorimeter will not loose
all their energy in the detector because the shower is not fully contained,
thus their energy cannot be properly reconstructed. For this reason
a fiducial cut is introduced on the track coordinates $U,V,W$
of the electrons at the EC plane. The $U,V,W$ coordinates are chosen for
convenience since they are parallel to the directions of the EC scintillators
(and to the EC edges). The cuts have been adjusted by looking at Fig.~\ref{fig:ccm_phi}
and making sure the distribution is $\phi$-symmetric
$$
40\leq U\leq400, V\leq362, W\leq395
$$
The $U,V,W$ distributions are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:ECu},\ref{fig:ECv},\ref{fig:ECw},
respectively. In average $80.9\%$ of all the events with an EC signal pass the U cut, $71.3\%$ the V cut
and $69.4\%$ the W cut, for a combined pass/total ratio of $58\%$. When all other cuts are applied
the U,V,W keep $96.6\%$, $88.6\%$, $86.8\%$ events respectively, for a combined effective cut of $77.8\%$
(the product of these numbers is  $74.2\%$ but the corners events are correlated).

In Fig.~\ref{fig:ECyx} is plotted the Y versus X track coordinate in the EC plane before and after
the $U,V,W$ cuts.

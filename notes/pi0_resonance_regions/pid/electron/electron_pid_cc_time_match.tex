\subsection{CC time Matching}\label{subsec:cc-time-matching}
The CC timing was not calibrated in e1-6, but a timing cut is still possible if applied to each tube
(this is basically equivalent to perform the timing calibration).

The difference $\Delta T$ between the track time recorded on a CC segment and corresponding time recorded on the TOF,
corrected for the path length from the CC to the TOF, is fitted with a gaussian (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cc_time_slices}).
Since there could be multiple \v Cerenkov light reflections leading to a time delay,
a 3 sigma cut is applied on the {\textit left} of the signal, and not on the right.
This difference is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:cc_time_sec1} for all tubes in sector one.

        corrected for the path length from the CC to the TOF ($|\vec{R_{CC}}-\vec{R_{SC}}|/c$),
        shown here for 4 CC pmts, is fitted with a gaussian.

    at a CC tube ($T_{CC}$) and corresponding time recorded on the TOF ($T_{SC}$),
        corrected for the path length from the CC to the TOF ($|\vec{R_{CC}}-\vec{R_{SC}}|/c$),

        Top left: all events. Top right: events with calorimeter cuts applied.
        notice that these cuts remove $71 \,^{\circ\!\!}/\!_\circ$ of the data.
        Bottom left: events with the negative calorimeter cuts applied.
        Bottom right: all cuts applied. Notice that the CC matching cut
        only removes $7  \,^{\circ\!\!}/\!_\circ$ of the events with
        the calorimeter cuts already applied.}
